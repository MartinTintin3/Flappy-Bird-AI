# Flappy Bird AI
This version of Flappy Bird (written in JS) uses my JS [implementation](https://github.com/martinGITHUBER/JS-Flappy-Bird) and the [Neuro Evolution](https://github.com/xviniette/FlappyLearning/blob/gh-pages/Neuroevolution.js) library to train the neural network to play flappy bird. You can change the population size in [config.js](js/config.js).
